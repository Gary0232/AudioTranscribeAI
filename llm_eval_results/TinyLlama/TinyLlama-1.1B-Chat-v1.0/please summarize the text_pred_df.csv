"#NotAllStarKids, the hashtag would read, if social media got wind of what Vivek Oberoi had to go through to bag the now-iconic role of Chandu in Ram Gopal Varma's 2002 film Company and made the story viral. Unlike the popular belief that industry kids get it easy, turns out it was not easy for Vivek Oberoi to convince RGV that he could pull off the character of Chandu.Company, which completed 15 years this week, is one of Bollywood's most iconic gangster films of all time. Written by Jaideep Sahni (who later went on to write Chak De! India) and directed by Ram Gopal Varma, Company was a fictional retelling of the bloody, real-life rivalry between crime bosses, Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Rajan.Fifteen years ago, Vivek Oberoi made his Bollywood debut with Company. Unlike conventional industry-kid debut vehicles which happen to be romantic films, Vivek Oberoi opted for a gritty, gangster film which was a risky career choice. But the film wowed critics and audiences alike and the rest is history.Speaking about how he got the role, Vivek Oberoi spoke to Hindustan Times and said, ""My father was planning to launch me in an Abbas Mustan film. But I always wanted to become an actor on my own, so I told him that I would like to go through my struggle. So I went to RGV sir's office, and told him to give me an audition for the role of Chandu. He did not know (then) that I was Suresh Oberoi's son. I told him my name was Vivek Anand. He told me I look too good for the role, and he wanted to cast someone who looked like a gangster from the slums.""Then, Vivek apparently asked for fifteen days from Ram Gopal Varma. He began staying in slums, sleeping on floors with mice roaming about, using public toilets and so on. Slowly, he began to look the part...""On the day, I was supposed to meet him, I took out some mud from a plant at his office and applied it on my face. I walked into his room, with a beedi in my mouth - I sat on the chair and kept my legs on his desk, and said, ' Ey yeh thobda kya dekh raha hai'. That convinced him,"" Vivek said.Vivek Oberoi also did a lot of stunts in the film despite acting in a movie for the first time.""I wanted to do everything, and I loved doing all the stunts. There was a sequence, in which I had to run for my life, jumping from one building to another in the bylanes of Kenya. For a steep jump, RGV had asked the stuntman to do it, and after he had finished the shot, RGV left. I, then persuaded the stunt director to shoot the same scene with me,"" Vivek said.","Actor Vivek Oberoi has revealed that he lived in slums and used public toilets to get a role in the 2002 film 'Company' as director Ram Gopal Varma found him too good-looking for the part. He added, ""When I finally met him, I...kept my legs on his desk, and said, 'Ey yeh thobda kya dekh raha hai'. That convinced him.""","The text is about the professional experiences of a Bollywood actor, Vivek Oberoi, who starred in the gangster film Company, which was released in 2002. Oberoi was an industry debutante at the time, but his decision to take on a challenging role and experience the hardships of being a gangster in a film was risky but ultimately rewarding. Oberoi narrates his experiences, including his audition process with director Ram Gopal Varma, staying in slums to fit the role, and even performing some stunts. Despite the challenges, he believes that his decision to take on the role was a wise one, as it allowed him to grow as an actor and experience something new.",3.6954528440254637
"Senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue Indresh Kumar on Saturday said that Muslims in India have understood that even Allah doesn't want an 'impure' mosque at the disputed site in Ayodhya.Speaking to India Today, the veteran RSS functionary and convener of its minority cell - Muslim Rashtriya Manch said, ""Muslims have realised that since Allah himself has not allowed the mosque to come up there, it's unlikely that it will ever come up.""Questioning the legitimacy of the Babri Masjid, Kumar said that the 15th century structure was named after an individual (Babur) and so it could never be used by Muslims as they only worshiped one God.""The land is disputed and it was claimed after destroying a Ram temple that existed there, thus Allah never accepted the structure and even namaz was never conducted at the place.

The only difference being that one is abstract and the other takes the form of Lord Ram,"" he added.According to Kumar, the minority community in India now realises that those who are trying to encroach the land forcefully were neither following the principles of Quran nor the Prophet, but were only interested in continuing the stalemate.""They believe that Ram is like their Nabi or Paigambar and most definitely that of their ancestors, thus they want a Ram Temple in Ayodhya to end the dispute forever.

"While infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) is getting a facelift owing to a torrent of Chinese investment, the terrorism framework in the area too is getting revamped in a bid to foment trouble in India, an India Today TV investigation on ground zero has found.Over 30 religious and jihadi groups have come together to form Daifa-e-Pakistan that has demonstrated and carried out rallies across Pakistan to step up terrorism in Kashmir.According to sources, the aim of the movement is to create a new force of terrorism and channel it against India. One such rally was organised by Daifa-e-Pakistan at Mall road in Lahore. The participants included the leaders of the banned terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hijbul Mujahideen, Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen, etc.They demonstrated against India and spelt out a negative propaganda allegedly after informing the government of Pakistan and its army.According to sources, Pakistan is leaving no stone unturned to stoke the unrest in Kashmir caused after the killing of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani last year.Though the US has declared Hafiz Saeed and Hijbul chief Syed Salahuddin global terrorists with rewards for their arrest, these two have been spreading venom against India in different cities of Pakistan.Indian agencies are concerned that the Pakistan-funded terror groups are roping in youngsters for their mission. Much like Hafiz Saeed's son, former ISI chief Hamid Gul's son is also echoing anti-India propaganda by creating associations to mobilise the youth.The number of infiltrators into the India this year has been the highest in the past decade, underscoring Pakistan's agenda. This has led to tension along the Line of Control and ceasefire violations.In the last nine years, after a devastating earthquake in 2006 in PoK, the infrastructure has undergone radical change. Not only roads, but hydropower projects and other ventures are visible on the ground .The pace at which these developmental projects are coming up is worrying for India. China's ""development"" projects"" in PoK and neighbouring Gilgit-Baltistan that involve several thousand Chinese personnel belonging to the construction corps of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) point towards Beijing's expansionist geo-strategic agenda in the region.Gilgit-Baltistan is part of the disputed territory of J&K occupied by Pakistan and is known as the Northern Areas of Pakistan. Some part of the Aksai Chin region was also gifted to China by Pakistan.Many people living in Gilgit and Baltistan are unnerved by the increasing Chinese presence in the area and feel that their resources and land are being sold to China by Pakistan without compensating the actual stakeholders, India Today TV found. Some even believe that all environmental issues are being ignored to favour economic interests of Pakistan.Farman Ali, a well-known journalist from Gilgit, said, ""People who raise their voices against Pakistan are either being jailed or harassed by Pakistani security agencies in Gilgit and Baltistan.""There are some in PoK who believe that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is going to help economic prosperity in the area but that will be clear only when the projects are completed and locals are engaged by Pakistan in economic activities.So far, residents have not been employed in construction work, except some security personnel who have been engaged for protection of Chinese workers.With the reported stationing of a unit of PLA soldiers near the Khunjerab Pass and Chinese military officials frequenting the field command office of Gilgit, which happens to be Pakistan's military headquarters in the region, a pervasive Chinese intent of establishing a military edge in India's northern sector cannot be negated, observers say.ALSO READ |Is China backing Pakistan's position on PoK projects under its China-Pakistan Economic Corridor plan?Pakistan China's new colony?

"Bengaluru, Apr 10 (PTI) Flipkart Co-founder Binny Bansal today said while the latest funding round provides the fuel the company needs to reach its goal of transforming commerce in India through technology, it should continue to grow its business with careful considerations to costs. ""I must stress that we still have some distance to go before fulfilling our mission - to transform commerce in India through technology. And, while this funding round provides the fuel we need need to reach that goal, we have to continue growing our business with careful considerations to costs,"" he said in a mail shot-off to his employees after raising USD 1.4 billion from Tencent Holdings, Microsoft Corp and eBay Inc. ""I look forward to your continued support,"" he added. The announcement comes in the wake of Flipkart, Indias largest e-commerce player, looking to cut cost by its plan to sack at least 700 employees, or over 3 per cent of its workforce, to compete with rivals like Amazon and Snapdeal. The funding announcement comes in the wake of Flipkart, being in the eye of a storm in recent times for lowering of valuation, which prompted them to make several changes in its business model, including raising margins, it charges from sellers. A host of Flipkarts investors had marked down their valuation estimates by up to 39 per cent in the recent past. At its peak, Flipkart was valued at over USD 15 billion (roughly Rs 1,00,830 crore). Giving reasons for the significance of the latest funding, Binny Bansal said it is the largest in the companys 10-year history and also in Indias internet sector. Bansal also said it provides solid growth capital so that the company can cement and extend its lead in Indias e-commerce market, and its valuation remains healthy and in double-digits, reflective of the current business and global economy. ""I am particularly excited from the strong confidence global tech giants have shown in our abilities. It is just an acknowledgement of the strides we have taken in improving peoples lives, it is also an endorsement of the opportunities ahead,"" he said. Bansal said the deals that the company has struck are important for them as e-commerce space accounts for less than two per cent of all retail in India and the potential for online retail alone is about USD 100 billion. ""As I have said before, the potential is vast and we have only just scratched the surface. E-commerce accounts for less than two per cent of all retail in India and the potential for online retail alone is about USD 100 billion. Which is why these deals are particularly important for all of us,"" he said. Bansal said these partnerships bring in a lot more than funds and set the company to compete more aggressively through innovations, which will enable them to collaborate deeply with eBay on cross-border trade and ensure their customers have a wider selection of international products to choose from.

"Naseeruddin Shah has watched the film Lipstick Under My Burkha, starring his wife Ratna Pathak Shah, twice. And the veteran actor can?t figure out why the film was initially denied certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), aka Censor Board. ?I really don?t know what problem they had with the film. I think they have a problem with female sexuality being portrayed on screen. What the film?s success has done is that it has shown [the Censor Board] up, and what they thought about the film. I have seen the film twice, and it?s a wonderfully made film that talks about what?s going on in society. I don?t know why the Censor Board had a problem with that,? he quips. The CBFC letter informing the filmmakers that certification wouldn?t be given had called the film ?lady-oriented?, a perplexing word that drew much ridicule from filmmakers and actors.

Naseeruddin Shah says, ?One has to ask a psychiatrist as to why they are afraid of [female sexuality] on screen.

On their way back, once Kovind has taken his oath, the two will exchange seats, leaving Mukherjee on the right and Kovind on the left.This buggy has interesting history at its tail. Here's where it comes from:WHERE DID THE BUGGY COME FROM?The gold-plated, horse-drawn buggy originally belonged to the Viceroy of India during the British era. How it remained in India after Independence is a story that will make many happy.After the partition, both India and Pakistan wanted the fancy buggy, and there was no longer a higher power to sort this quarrel. So, what did they do to sort the dispute?Simple. They did what cricket captains do these days. They tossed.Lt Col Thakur Govind Singh from India and Pakistan Army's Sahabzada Yaqub Khan let the responsibility of the buggy ownership rest on a coin.Guess who won the toss?Of course, India did. And here we are, after all these years, still using the old gal to flaunt around our newly-elected presidents.BUGGY'S USEAfter 1984, the buggy was not frequently used by any president for a few decades. While they did use it now and then, it was properly used again in 2014 by Pranab Mukherjee.Earlier, the gold-plated buggy was used by the president not only for ceremonial purposes, but also to move around in his 320-acre residential space.","The buggy which Indian Presidents ride for the oath-taking ceremony originally belonged to the Viceroy of India during the British era. After the partition of India and Pakistan, both sides tossed a coin to decide who would get the buggy, and India won the toss.

"In a setback to the minority Hindu and Sikh communities in Jammu and Kashmir, the Mehbooba Mufti-led PDP-BJP government in the state, through an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, has opposed creation of a minority commission in the state.The state government was responding to a PIL filed by a Jammu-based lawyer Ankur Sharma, seeking a direction to set up a minority commission in the state to safeguard the interests of religious and linguistic minorities. ""In the absence of a minority commission, the benefits exclusively meant for the minority communities including crores worth aid are being given away to a certain community, which is the majority Muslim community, in an illegal and arbitrary manner,"" Sharma had submitted.Jammu and Kashmir law secretary Abdul Majid Bhat contended that Sharma's view, saying, ""Assertion of the petitioner for setting up a state minority commission in Jammu and Kashmir through proper legislation including time-bound identification and notification of religious and linguistic minorities by the state is legally not maintainable. It is up to the concerned state/Union territory to set up a minority commission in their respective state/Union territory.""'The Jammu and Kashmir government said law is well settled on the issue that the apex court cannot direct the government to legislate on a particular subject.

The Union government indirectly recognises Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Christians of Jammu and Kashmir as 'minorities'.This is in spite of the fact that the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992, is not applicable to J-K and thus the recognition of Muslims as ""minorities"" is whimsical and illegal, the plea said.

"England pace spearhead James Anderson, who is one of the senior members of the national team, has admitted he was a bit disappointed after he was overlooked for the role of Test captain following Alastair Cook's decision to step down from the post.Cook had earlier this year stepped down as England's Test captain after a record 59 matches in charge. His tour of the subcontinent, which included a maiden Test defeat against Bangladesh, culminated with a 0-4 loss in the five-Test series against India.Joe Root was appointed as his replacement, with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) almost immediately announcing the decision.""I don't know if I'd have taken the captaincy but it would have been nice to have been considered for it,"" ESPNcricinfo quoted Anderson as saying.""From a personal point of view I'd have seriously thought about it, but from the outside looking in I'd have thought: is this actually where the team needs to go - with a 34-year-old as captain?""""I don't know how long I'm going to keep going for and in the grand scheme of things it makes sense for a younger guy to do it,"" he added.Anderson, who is a veteran of 122 Tests and England's all-time leading wicket-taker, pointed out that most of the fast bowling captains he had known have been pretty successful and was thus surprised why more fast bowlers aren't given the opportunity to do it.""I'm all for bowlers being captains,"" he said.Anderson's arguments can be backed up seeing the examples of Shaun Pollock, Courtney Walsh, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis who have successfully led their sides in all the formats of the game.The 34-year-old will play for Lancashire in the County Championship, in a bid to get match fit after sustaining a shoulder injury during England's tour of India last year.","England's leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson has admitted he would've seriously thought about Test captaincy, following Alastair Cook's resignation in February.
